   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>These baked chicken wings are juicy and tender inside, with perfectly crispy skin, thanks to an amazing homemade spice rub.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. (900g) split chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Cayenne</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon cumin </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant chicken stock (optional)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps:</h3>
   <ol>
        <li><p>To make the baked chicken wings: In a small bow or shallow plate, combine garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, Cayenne, pepper, salt, and instant chicken stock.</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange the chicken wings in a large salad bowl, drizzle with oil, and sprinkle with the spice mix. Mix thoroughly so the chicken is coated. Allow to rest for 30 minutes; overnight in the refrigerator is best. In the meantime, preheat your oven to 450ºF (230ºC) and set the rack to the middle position.</p></li>
        <li><p>When ready to bake, spread the chicken wings on a rimmed baking sheet (you can line it with foil or parchment paper).</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the baking sheet with the wings in the oven and reduce the temperature to 340ºF (170ºC) for 50 minutes to 1 hour. You can flip the wings at mid-cooking time if you like.</p></li>
        <li><p>Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven and place it on a cooling rack. Let rest for 5 minutes. This will help the baked chicken wings retain more of their crispiness. Garnish with lemon slices and cilantro if you like. Enjoy! ❤️</p></li>
